/**
 * Testimonials Component
 *
 * This component renders a section of patient testimonials for a dental service.
 * It imports images for each testimonial author and uses a reusable TestimonialCard
 * component to display individual testimonials.
 *
 * The component defines an array of testimonial objects, each containing:
 * - authorPhoto: Imported image of the testimonial author
 * - authorName: Name of the author
 * - authorLocation: Location of the author (all set to "California" in this instance)
 * - review: The text content of the testimonial
 *
 * The rendered section includes:
 * - A header with the title "Testimonials" and subtitle "What Our Patients Says"
 * - A container that maps through the testimonials array and renders a TestimonialCard
 *   for each testimonial
 *
 * The layout uses Bootstrap classes for responsive design and styling.
